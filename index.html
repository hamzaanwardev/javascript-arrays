    <h1>JavaScript Arrays</h1>
    <p>Going further for DataStructure.</p>
    <p>Arrays are used to store multiple data in a single variable. before it we have to make so many variables for that purpose.</p>
    <code>
        let friend1 = 'Ahmad';
        let friend1 = 'Amjad';
        let friend3 = 'Ali';
        <p>without Array we can store data as you can see above.</p>
        <p>But Arrays make our work easy.</p>
        let friends = ['Ahmad', 'Amjad', 'Ali'];
        <p>we can write it in another way, by using Array method. as you  can  see that there are round brakets with Array this means that it is a function or method. And it is neccessary to to use new keyword with it.</p>
        let friends = new Array('Ahmad', 'Amjad', 'Ali');
    </code>

    <script>
        let friends = ['Ahmad', 'Amjad', 'Ali'];
        console.log(friends);
        console.log(friends[0]);
        // if we want to get last element of the variable then we have to do
        console.log(friends[friends.length - 1]);
        // if i want to replace our any element in array. supppose i am want to change secound element of above array to Akbar then,
        friends[1] = 'Akbar';
        console.log(friends);

        // Js can store data of different Types
        let birthYear = 1998;
        let me = ['Muhammad', 'Hamza', 'Anwar', new Date().getFullYear() - birthYear, 'FrontEnd Developer', friends];
        // we can pass the whole expression as an element in JS. As you can see i have done in the last element of array.
        console.log(me);
        console.log(me.length);
    </script>
